This project contains a jsp file and a xml file. The jsp is repsonsable for parsing and displaying the questions and answers contained in the XML to the user in the form of a quiz. The quiz is true or false and checks the answers against the answers in the XML. The score will be displayed to the user and the answers cleared if the user wishes to take the quiz again. 

# !!!!!To run you must change the XML filepath to the absolute file path where it is located!!!!

 I tried using a realative path so you can just download the code and run it without modifying the file path but every path but absolute would not work.
